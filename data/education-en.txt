Personalized Learning Paths: As an educator, I want to analyze student learning styles, strengths, and weaknesses so I can offer personalized learning paths (adaptive exercises, customized content recommendations) that cater to individual needs and optimize learning outcomes.
Student Acquisition and Retention: As a marketing manager, I want to track student acquisition sources (online ads, school partnerships, app store rankings) so I can identify the most effective channels and optimize marketing strategies. Additionally, I want to analyze retention data (course completion rates, student feedback) to understand why students disengage and implement strategies to improve motivation and persistence.

Academic Integrity and Plagiarism Detection: As an academic integrity specialist, I want to implement plagiarism detection tools and secure assessment environments so I can maintain academic honesty and ensure fair evaluation of student work.
App Performance and Accessibility: As a software engineer, I want to monitor app performance (loading times, video streaming quality, cross-platform compatibility) and ensure accessibility for students with disabilities so I can provide a seamless and inclusive learning experience.
